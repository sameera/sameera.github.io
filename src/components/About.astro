                                        ... While in WSO2, Sameera came up with
                                        many innovative ideas to improve the
                                        efficiency of the engineering management
                                        such as people allocation for various
                                        tasks, etc., which we are still using.
                                        He was very close to the team members,
                                        mentored them continuously and helping
                                        them to excel in their career... He also
                                        has an excellent UX knowledge, which we
                                        used heavily in WSO2...
